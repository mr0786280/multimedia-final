AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT I TRIED TO DO

	It might look like something that was thrown together messily, but I had to look up a few tutorials for some of the things that are displayed on my webpage. 
		
			1) The moving h1 was my attempt at animate text. Not sure if that looks good or not but to me it looks like the header is kind of breathing. 
			
			2) I also added the heart and the center and made it "breathe". For this one I looked for tutorials since creativity was low... 
			
			3) I also added the moon/star image and tried to animate it. It actually worked and it boosted the moral I kinda lost when things weren't working before. I used the rotation animation from one of the class assignments in trinket and tweeked it a little to making it looking like a "hanging" moon.
			
			4) I definitely found a tutorial on this but I also added a trail for the cursor. Originally, I wanted it to be a custome cursor but nothing was working and images wouldn't work with the code I'd picked up from the tutorial video, so I changed the color to fit my (messy) scheme.
